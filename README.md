Wilson KL, Hilborn A, Clay S, Devred E (2023) Improving satellite chlorophyll-a retrieval in the turbid waters of the Bay of Fundy, Canada (In prep) Estuaries and Coasts

This project focused on improving chl-a and SPM retrieval in the Bay of Fundy.

The yearly and seasonal climatology layers are hosted on Open Data at:

### MODIS-Aqua Image Processing Steps:

MODIS-Aqua [L1A images](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/docs/product-levels/) are downloaded from the NASA [Ocean Biology Processing Group](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) and processed with [SeaDAS](https://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/) `l2gen`. Using this level and program the atmospheric correction and resolution details can be customized. Once the images are atmospherically corrected, further products are calculated from the Remote-sensing reflectance (*R<sub>rs</sub>*), regridded onto a common grid, and merged into daily composites. All further analysis occured using the regridded daily composites at 300 m spatial resolution.
